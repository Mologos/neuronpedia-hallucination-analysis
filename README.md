# neuronpedia-hallucination-analysis
This repository is for testing and exploration purposes.  
The goal is to evaluate whether the [Neuronpedia API](https://www.neuronpedia.org/api-doc) 
can be used to analyze **hallucination-like behavior** in large language models (LLMs).  

Neuronpedia provides **token attribution graphs**, which reveal how different tokens 
influence each other during generation. By analyzing these graphs, we can explore 
whether hallucinations leave detectable patterns.
